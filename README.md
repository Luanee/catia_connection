# catia_connection

###  About
Catia_connection enables quick and easy access to CATIA via the package pycatia. Some methods have thus already been combined into functions that provide a first insight into the structure of a product, the search for an item or the output of all information of a part/product with regard to mass and so on.

###  Requirements
- Python 3.7.3
- See requierements.txt
- CATIA V5 running on Windows.
+ Part from pycatia.mec_mod_interfaces.part.py must be extended by the method "analyze" (see pycatia.product_structure_interfaces.product.py)
